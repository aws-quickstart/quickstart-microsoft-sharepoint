=== Create initial content

This step assumes that you deployed a SharePoint farm rather than a single server, and that the server name prefix value is SPServer. In this scenario, we assume that the SharePoint farm host an internal site, and then we set up a modern team site to validate our test.

After successfully launching the stack, create an RDP connection into the environment through one of the RD Gateway instances. You can retrieve the Elastic IP address for each RD Gateway instance from the Amazon EC2 console.

[start=1]
. Establish an RDP session to the primary SharePoint server. It is SPServer1 if you deployed a SharePoint farm with the default parameters, and SP if you deployed a single SharePoint server with default parameters. From the *Start* menu, choose *SharePoint 2019 Central Administration*. When prompted to run this as an administrator, choose *OK*. A web browser opens to http://spadmin.example.com. When prompted for credentials, use the domain administrator name and password.
. On the central administration home page, choose *Create site collections*.

[#PostDeploy1]
.Creating site collections
[link=images/image17.png]
image::../images/image17.png[PostDeploy1,image,width=283,height=151]

[start=3]
. Provide a *Title* for your site, and then choose the *Collaboration* tab and choose the *team site* template.

[#PostDeploy2]
.Creating a team site
[link=images/image18.png]
image::../images/image18.png[PostDeploy2,image,width=648,height=562]

You must define a *Primary Site Collection Administrator* on this page. You can use either the domain administrator account for this value, or any other valid account within the domain. When you finish filling out the form, choose *OK*.

[start=4]
. Now that you have a team site, navigate to http://sharepoint.example.com. When prompted, specify the administrator credentials that you set in the preceding step above. If the site loads, your SharePoint server is ready.

[#PostDeploy3]
.Team site

=== Make the SharePoint databases highly available

NOTE: This step is not required if deploying a SharePoint farm into a new VPC.

[[enable-full-recovery-mode]]
==== Enable full recovery model

[start=1]
. Establish an RDP session to the WSFCNODE1 instance. Start SQL Server Management Studio, and then choose *Connect* to connect to the local server.

[#PostDeploy4]
.Connecting to WSFCNODE1
[link=images/image7.png]
image::../images/image7.png[PostDeploy4,image,width=477,height=315]

[start=2]
. For the four search databases, and the usage database, you will need to enable the full recovery model before you can add them to the availability group. In *Object Explorer*, expand the *Databases* node.
. For each database, choose the context (right-click) menu, and then choose *Properties*. In the *Database Properties* dialog box, choose the *Options* page, and then change *Recovery Model* to *Full*.

image::../images/image20.png[PostDeploy5,image,width=648,height=586]

[[back-up-the-databases]]
==== Back up the databases

Next, make a backup of each SharePoint database. They all share a common prefix that begins with the name of your AWS CloudFormation stack.

[start=1]
. To make a backup, choose the context (right-click) menu for the database name, choose *Tasks*, and then choose *Back up*.

[#PostDeploy6]
.Backing up a database
[link=images/image21.png]
image::../images/image21.png[PostDeploy6,image,width=648,height=358]

[start=2]
. Keep the default settings, and then choose *OK* to create a backup.

[[add-the-databases-to-the-availability-group]]
==== Add the databases to the availability group


[start=1]
. In *Object Explorer*, open the *Always On High Availability* folder. Then open the *Availability Groups* folder.
. Choose *Add Database* from the availability group's context menu.

[#PostDeploy7]
.Choosing Add Database for the availability group
[link=images/image22.png]

. Connect to WSFCNODE2 to allow the databases to be added to the availability group there. 
. Choose the *Connect* button. 
. Choose *Next*.
. Choose *Automatic seeding* to tell SQL Server to automatically copy the databases to the replica.

[#PostDeploy9]
.Choosing automatic seeding to populate secondary replicas
[link=images/image24.png]
image::../images/image24.png[PostDeploy9,image,width=648,height=352]

[start=6]
. Ensure that the validation checks pass. 
. Choose *Next*.
. Choose *Finish*. The databases are now part of the availability group.

[#PostDeploy10]
.Validation checks before adding the databases to the availability group
[link=images/image25.png]
image::../images/image25.png[PostDeploy10,image,width=648,height=260]

[[provide-log-access-to-the-secondary-database-server]]
=== Provide log access to the secondary database server

Ensure that if there is a failover event, the SharePoint service accounts have access to log in to the secondary database server.

To do this, follow the instructions on the Microsoft https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/918992/how-to-transfer-logins-and-passwords-between-instances-of-sql-server[How to transfer logins and passwords between instances of SQL Server] support page. When you run the generated script against the secondary server, you might see errors for accounts that already exists, which is normal. The script, however, adds the user logins that do not already exist on the secondary server. If you add additional server accounts or users at a later stage, ensure that you run this script again to add them to the secondary server.

=== Enable multiple-subnet failover

Since the SharePoint databases are replicated across subnets, the last step is to tell SharePoint that multiple-subnet failover is required. To enable multiple-subnet failover for the SharePoint databases, on the *SPServer1* server, run Windows PowerShell with administrative permissions and execute the following PowerShell code.

----
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell

$dbs = Get-SPDatabase | ?\{$_.MultiSubnetFailover -ne $true}

foreach ($db in $dbs) \{

$db.MultiSubnetFailover = $true

$db.Update()

}
----

=== Test automatic failover
:xrefstyle: short
After your external SharePoint site is available, you can test automatic failover. On the Amazon EC2 console, stop WSFCNode 1, SPServer1, and SPServer3. (You can stop the instances simultaneously, as shown in <<PostDeploy11>>.)

[#PostDeploy11]
.Stopping the instances in Availability Zone 1
[link=images/image26.png]
image::../images/image26.png[PostDeploy11,image,width=625,height=369]

The SharePoint databases should fail over automatically to the second WSFC node. The load balancers should detect that SPServer1 and SPServer3 have gone offline and should direct HTTP traffic to SPServer2 and SPServer4, respectively. You can revisit the site and the central administrator site in your web browser to confirm that everything is still working.

The primary database server should be the first WSFC node. The Network Load Balancer for the back end (central administrator site) distributes HTTP requests across SPServer1 and SPServer2. The Application Load Balancer for the front end distributes HTTP requests across SPServer3 and SPServer4.

[[server-role-architecture]]
=== Server role architecture

[[single-server-topology]]
==== Single-server topology

A single-server deployment of SharePoint 2019 is ideal for development environments and for small-scale testing of SharePoint where multiple servers might be excessive.

[#PostDeploy12]
.A single-server SharePoint topology
[link=images/image32.png]
image::../images/image32.png[PostDeploy12,image,width=417,height=164]

In this topology, all SharePoint service applications and instances will run on one server with no load balancing being required. The database server, however, runs on a different server than SharePoint.

[[multiple-server-topology]]
==== Multiple-server topology

The multiple-server template uses four SharePoint servers in two different roles to distribute the load.

[#PostDeploy13]
.An example of how multiple-server topologies in SharePoint can work
[link=images/image33.png]
image::../images/image33.png[PostDeploy13,image,width=417,height=248]

This Quick Start uses the SharePoint MinRole feature to evenly distribute services among servers in a SharePoint farm deployment. This Quick Start uses the following MinRole roles:

* Front end: Front end with distributed cache
* Application servers: Application with search

For more information about MinRole, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/install/overview-of-minrole-server-roles-in-sharepoint-server[Overview of MinRole Server Roles in SharePoint Servers 2016 and 2019].

:xrefstyle: short
With two servers in both roles (to support high availability), the resulting architecture is shown in <<PostDeploy14>>>>.

[#PostDeploy14]
.Multiple-server topology
[link=images/architecture_diagram.png]
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[PostDeploy14,image,width=738,height=434]

To help ensure the highest availability, the servers are set up in different Availability Zones. This helps to ensure that if an entire Availability Zone is impaired, the servers in the second Availability Zone are still running.

[[load-balancing]]
===== Load balancing

The multiple-server version of the Quick Start deploys two load balancers. The first is an Application Load Balancer and is for the front-end servers, which run the main SharePoint web applications. The second is a Network Load Balancer and is for the application servers, where the central administration website runs.

The load balancers direct traffic to a healthy node in the target group. Every 30 seconds, they poll port 80 for an available connection. If a node fails three consecutive checks, the load balancer will not direct any requests to it until it is again registered as healthy.

[[database-tier]]
===== Database tier

The database server role stores content and service data so that your SharePoint farm can utilize SQL Server in a number of ways. For small or medium-sized environments, you may be able to place all your databases on a single server. For larger-sized farms, you can spread your databases across multiple SQL Server instances or clusters of SQL Server instances. We recommend using SQL Server Enterprise in your SharePoint deployment, as it meets the performance, high availability, and reliability requirements for an enterprise application.

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for SQL Server Express, SQL Server Web Edition, and SQL Server Standard are available for launch on AWS. To install SQL Server 2016 or 2017 Enterprise Edition on AWS, you can use http://aws.amazon.com/windows/mslicensemobility/[Microsoft License Mobility through Software Assurance] to bring your own license into the cloud.

As explained in https://fwd.aws/GRNKR[Quick Start for Microsoft WSFC and SQL Server Always On on AWS], we provide a way to deploy an *Always On* availability group to provide high availability for databases. Our default SQL Server configuration uses the r4.2xlarge instance type, which is a memory-optimized instance with 8 virtual CPUs (vCPUs), 61 GiB of memory, and 100 GiB of SSD instance storage. Additionally, we provide high-performance, durable storage through Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

[[intranet-sharepoint-server-farm-on-aws]]
==== Intranet SharePoint server farm on AWS

The architecture diagrams shown up to this point represent an isolated Microsoft SharePoint farm. For this scenario, domain users on the SharePoint network can access the content, but it's closed off to anyone outside the SharePoint domain and network. To allow access for a corporate network, the architecture must include private connectivity from the on-premises environment. <<PostDeploy15>> shows a typical topology for an intranet SharePoint server farm running on the AWS Cloud.

:xrefstyle: short
[#PostDeploy15]
.Intranet SharePoint server farm topology
[link=images/image35.png]
image::../images/image35.png[PostDeploy15,image,width=743,height=434]

In <<PostDeploy15>>, we created a VPN tunnel from the customer gateway to the VPN gateway running in the VPC (to enable internal network connectivity to the VPC). The customer gateway is an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)-capable device.

In addition, AWS offers the AWS Direct Connect service, which allows you to create a direct network connection from your data center into the AWS Cloud. In either case, when you connect to the VPC from your on-premises environment, you can provision internal Elastic Load Balancing to spread incoming traffic to front-end servers across each Availability Zone. Elastic Load Balancing provides high availability if a server fails. If a web front-end server is unavailable, requests are sent to one that is online.

[[security]]
==== Security

As with any enterprise application deployment, a Microsoft SharePoint Server farm on AWS should implement strict security controls. AWS provides a comprehensive set of security features that allow you to control the flow of traffic through your VPC, associated subnets, and ultimately to each Amazon EC2 instance. These features can reduce your environment's attack surface while providing end-user access to SharePoint content and applications, in addition to administrator access for managing Windows Server infrastructure.

[[security-groups]]
===== Security groups

When launched, Amazon EC2 instances must be associated with at least one security group which acts as a stateful firewall. You control the network traffic of your security group and build granular rules that are scoped by protocol, port number, and source/destination IP address or subnet. By default, all outbound traffic is permitted by the security group. Inbound traffic, however, must be configured to allow appropriate traffic to reach your instances.

The https://https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-microsoft-platform-security.pdf[Securing the Microsoft Platform on Amazon Web Services] whitepaper discusses the different methods for securing your AWS infrastructure in detail. Recommendations include providing isolation between application tiers using security groups. We recommend that you tightly control ingress traffic in order to reduce the attack surface of your Amazon EC2 instances.

[[network-acls]]
===== Network ACLs

A network access control list (ACL) is a set of permissions that can be attached to any network subnet in a VPC to provide stateless filtering of traffic. Network ACLs can be used for inbound or outbound traffic, and provide an effective way to blacklist a CIDR block or individual IP addresses. These ACLs can contain ordered rules to allow or deny traffic based upon IP protocol, service port, or source or destination IP address. Figure 21 shows the default ACL configuration for a VPC subnet.

[#PostDeploy16]
.Default network ACL configuration for a VPC subnet
[link=images/image36.png]
image::../images/image36.png[PostDeploy16,image,width=597,height=281]

You can keep the default network ACL configuration or add more specific rules to restrict traffic between subnets at the network level. Typically, network ACLs will mirror your security group rules. One benefit of multiple layers of network security (security groups and network ACLs) is that each layer can be managed by a separate group in your organization. If a server administrator inadvertently exposes unnecessary network ports on a security group, a network administrator could supersede this configuration by blocking that traffic at the network ACL layer.

[[secure-extranet-publishing]]
===== Secure extranet publishing

Some organizations may use SharePoint Server to host a publicly accessible extranet. In this scenario, you can add another layer of security by placing reverse proxy servers into your public subnet to provide additional security and threat management. In this configuration, the public subnet acts like the DMZ that you would typically use in a physical network environment. Web page requests from internet-based users would be sent to these reverse proxy servers, which would then establish a connection to your web front-end servers that are running in a private subnet.

<<PostDeploy17>> shows an example of publishing SharePoint web front-end servers, located in a private subnet, through a reverse proxy server deployed into a public subnet.

:xrefstyle: short
[#PostDeploy17]
.Web application publishing with a reverse proxy server
[link=images/image37.png]
image::../images/image37.png[PostDeploy17,image,width=648,height=389]

A benefit of this architecture is that it provides the ability to pre-authenticate users at the perimeter of your network while shielding your internal SharePoint servers from the public internet. Several third-party appliances and applications can be used for this task. Microsoftâ€™s Web Application Proxy role in Windows Server 2019 also provides support for publishing your SharePoint resources to the internet.

The AWS CloudFormation template provided by this Quick Start does not set up an environment for extranet publishing, but after the deployment, you may choose to add reverse proxy servers and configure the environment thatâ€™s illustrated in <<PostDeploy17>>.

[[ec2-instance-types]]
==== EC2 instance types

Properly planning for capacity and sizing servers is a key aspect of every enterprise application deployment. As such, it is important that you choose the appropriate Amazon EC2 instance type for each server role in your SharePoint deployment. Since each deployment is different, you will need to follow Microsoftâ€™s detailed guidance on how to properly size your environment based on the number of users and workloads involved. As a starting point, consider the minimum requirements for each server role.

The following values are based on minimum requirements for all server roles operating in a three-tier farm.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=================================================================================
|Role |Processor |RAM |Boot volume
|Web front-end server / front-end server |64-bit, 4 cores |12 GiB |80 GiB
|Application server / batch processing / back end |64-bit, 4 cores |12 GiB |80 GiB
|Database server (fewer than 1,000 users) |64-bit, 4 cores |8 GiB |80 GiB
|Database server (between 1,000 and 10,000 users) |64-bit, 8 cores |16 GiB |80 GiB
|=================================================================================

The Quick Start uses the following instance types by default. These provide additional capacity over the absolute minimum requirements as a starting point.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Role |EC2 instance type |Boot volume
|Web front-end server / front-end server |m4.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB memory) |100 GiB (EBS/GP2)
|Application server / batch processing / back end |m4.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB memory) |100 GiB (EBS/GP2)
|Database server |r4.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 61 GiB memory) |100 GiB (EBS/GP2)
|======================================================================================================

Amazon EBS volumes are used as the boot volume for each instance. Notice that we use the EBS General Purpose (gp2) volume type. This is an SSD-backed EBS volume that is used as the default boot volume type for all EC2 instances. These gp2 volumes provide a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GiB and are burstable up to 3,000 IOPS.

When you launch the AWS CloudFormation template in this guide, youâ€™ll be given the opportunity to adjust these instance types.[[_Customize_Your_Topology]]
