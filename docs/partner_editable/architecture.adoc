.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
[link=images/architecture_diagram.png]
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture1,width=740,height=434]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Remote Desktop gateway (RD gateway) in an Auto Scaling group to allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*

In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.

* An Application Load Balancer for the SharePoint front-end servers.
* Two Amazon EC2 instances serving as Microsoft SharePoint front-end servers.
* A Network Load Balancer for the SharePoint application servers.
* Two Amazon EC2 instances serving as Microsoft SharePoint application servers.
* Two Amazon EC2 instances serving as Microsoft SQL Servers in a highly-available cluster.
* An Amazon EC2 instance serving as a Windows failover clustering file share witness.
* Two Amazon EC2 instances serving as Microsoft Active Directory domain controllers.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

[NOTE]
===============================
In the deployment shown in <<architecture1>>, the AWS CloudFormation templates provided with this Quick Start deploy the SharePoint servers. Active Directory and SQL Server are deployed using https://fwd.aws/N6e7B[Active Directory Domain Services on AWS] and https://fwd.aws/GRNKR[SQL Server on AWS] Quick Starts, respectively. 

When deploying into a new VPC, you do not have to run the Active Directory and SQL Server Quick Starts separately. Before deploying SharePoint 2019 to an existing VPC, see link:#configure-aws-prerequisites[Configure AWS prerequisites]] later in this guide.
===============================

== VPC, Active Directory, and RD Gateway configuration

[[vpc-configuration]]
=== VPC configuration

When deploying a Windows-based architecture on the AWS Cloud, we recommend a VPC configuration that supports the following requirements:

* Critical workloads should be placed in a minimum of two Availability Zones to provide high availability.
* Internal application servers and other non-internet facing servers should be placed in private subnets to prevent direct access to these instances from the internet.
* RD gateways should be deployed into public subnets in each Availability Zone for remote administration. Other components, such as reverse proxy servers, can also be placed into these public subnets if needed.

For details on the VPC design used in this reference, see the https://fwd.aws/N6e7B[Active Directory Domain Services on the AWS Cloud].

Based on these best practices, NAT gateways are deployed into the public subnets. The public subnets have a route to the internet directly through the internet gateway attached to the VPC.

Instances that deploy in the private subnets have no direct route to the internet. Instead, instances in private subnets use private routes to send internet traffic to the NAT gateways in the public subnets. This architecture isolates your critical workloads from direct internet access.

[[active-directory-domain-services]]
=== Active Directory Domain Services

To provide user authentication and authorization, the Microsoft SharePoint servers in this reference architecture use Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). As you deploy your environment, you should place at least one domain controller in a private subnet in each Availability Zone for redundancy and high availability. This Quick Start includes a domain controller in the Active Directory tier in each Availability Zone.

There are two ways to use AD DS in the AWS Cloud:

* Cloud only – This type of architecture means that your entire Active Directory forest exists only within the AWS Cloud. There are no on-premises domain controllers.
* Hybrid – The hybrid architecture takes advantage of your existing AD DS environment. You can extend your private, on-premises network to AWS so the resources in the cloud can use your existing Active Directory infrastructure. In a hybrid architecture, we recommend that you deploy domain controllers for your existing Active Directory forest to the AWS Cloud. We recommend this configuration primarily to ensure that the deployed application servers remain functional and available if there is an on-premises outage.

The https://fwd.aws/N6e7B[Active Directory Domain Services on the AWS Cloud] Quick Start covers best practices and recommendations for deploying AD DS on AWS. This Quick Start has you launch the AD DS Quick Start, which uses our best practices to deploy the Active Directory environment.

[[remote-administration]]
=== Remote administration

As we design the architecture for a highly available SharePoint farm, we should also design for highly available and secure remote access. We can do this by deploying an RD Gateway in each Availability Zone. If an Availability Zone outage occurs, this architecture provides access to failed resources using another Availability Zone.

The RD Gateway uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over HTTPS to help establish a secure, encrypted connection between remote administrators on the internet and Windows-based EC2 instances. This does not require you to configure a virtual private network (VPN) connection. This allows you to reduce vulnerabilities on your Windows-based instances during remote administration.

The AWS CloudFormation templates provided in this Quick Start automatically deploy the architecture described in https://fwd.aws/5VrKP[Remote Desktop Gateway on the AWS Cloud: Quick Start Reference Deployment]. After you launch your SharePoint infrastructure using a deployment option in this guide, you initially connect to your instances using the standard RDP TCP port 3389. You can then follow the steps in this guide to secure future connections via HTTPS. (See link:#post-deployment-steps[Post-deployment steps].)
